an experiment about u+1680

Just a little experiment, heavily related to and inspired by [@jagracey](https://github.com/jagracey), who made an awesome research about [unicode](https://github.com/jagracey/Awesome-unicode).

On load, it searches all script tags' contents. If there is a u+1680 char, it tries to decode. It is just binary code (space is a zero, u+1680 is a one) which is converted to chars.
